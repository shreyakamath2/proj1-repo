## Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement Study:
An exploratory data analysis conducted in Python on the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys. The goal of this study is to use the data collected to provide insights on the computing courses at CCM and aid the Information Technologies department in increasing enrollment in computing classes.
## Data Science Questions:
The four questions I was trying to answer with this project are:
1. Of the five courses surveyed, which course(s) resulted in the highest amounts of interest in taking other computing courses?
2. Are older (>=25) students more likely to be enrolled in a degree-granting program, or a certification of achievement?
3. Are women more likely to enroll in CMP 128 or CMP 131?
4. What are the most common way(s) students learned about the County College of Morris?
## Project Files:
You can find 4 different project files in this GitHub Repository.
1. Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv is a CSV file containing all the raw, uncleaned data taken from the Computing Majors survey
2. cleaned_survey.csv - This is a CSV file that contains the resulting dataframe post cleaning with Pandas, with only the information pertinent to answering the data science questions included
3. Proj1DataCleaning.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code used to clean the the Major Survey Results file and create the cleaned_survey file
4. Proj1Plots.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that contains all the code used to create plots to answer the four data science questions, along with my personal insights and recommendations
